test,Much have I travelled in the realms of gold
test,And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
test,Round many western islands I have been
test,Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
test,Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
test,That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne;
test,Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
test,Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
test,Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
test,When a new planet swims into his ken;
test,Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
test,He stared at the Pacific -- and all his men
test,Looked at each other with a wild surmise --
test,"Silent, upon a peak in Darien."
test,"I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life."
test,"I met a traveller from an antique land,"
test,"Who said -- ""Two vast and trunkless legs of stone"
test,"Stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,"
test,"Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,"
test,"And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,"
test,Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
test,"Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,"
test,"The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;"
test,"And on the pedestal, these words appear:"
test,"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;"
test,"Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
test,Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
test,"Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare"
test,"The lone and level sands stretch far away."""
test,And all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves.
test,"Leaning into the afternoons, "
test,I cast my sad nets towards your oceanic eyes.
test,"There, in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames;"
test,Its arms turning like a drowning man's.
test,I send out red signals across your absent eyes
test,That smell like the sea or the beach by a lighthouse.
test,"You keep only darkness, my distant female,"
test,From your regards sometimes the coast of dread emerges.
test,Leaning into the afternoons I fling my sad nets
test,To that sea that is thrashed by your oceanic eyes.
test,The birds of the night peck at the first stars
test,That flash like my soul when I love you.
test,The night gallops on its shadowy mare
test,Shedding blue tassels over the land.
test,The great tapestries of trees had darkened to ghosts back at the last edge of twilight.
test,"The early moon had drenched the arches with pale blue, and, weaving over the night,"
test,"In and out of the gossamer rifts of the moon, swept a song,"
test,"A song with more than a hint of sadness, infinitely transient, infinitely regretful."
test,The time you won your town the race we chaired you through the market-place;
test,"Man and boy stood cheering by, and home we brought you shoulder-high"
test,"Today the road all runners come, shoulder-high we bring you home,"
test,"And set you at your threshold down, townsmen of a stiller town."
test,"Smart lad, to slip betimes away, from fields where glory does not stay,"
test,"And early though the laurel grows, it withers quicker than the rose."
test,"Eyes the shady night has shut cannot see the record cut,"
test,And silence sounds no worse than cheers after earth has stopped the ears.
test,"Now you will not swell the rout of lads that wore their honuors out,"
test,Runners whom renown outran and the name died before the man.
test,"So set, before its echoes fade, the fleet foot on the sill of shade,"
test,And hold to the low lintel up the still-defended challenge-cup.
test,"And round that early-laurelled head will flock to gaze the strengthless dead,"
test,And find unwithered on its curls the garland briefer than a girl's.
test,"I am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art."
test,"It was many and many a year ago, in the kingdom by the sea,"
test,That a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of Annabel Lee;
test,And this maiden she lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me.
test,"I was a child and she was a child in this kingdom by the sea,"
test,But we loved with a love that was more than love -- I and my Annabel Lee --
test,With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven coveted her and me.
test,"And this was the reason that, long ago, in this kingdom by the sea,"
test,"A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling my beautiful Annabel Lee;"
test,"So that her highborn kinsmen came and bore her away from me,"
test,To shut her up in that sepulchre in this kingdom by the sea.
test,"The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, went envying her and me --"
test,"Yes! -- that was the reason (as all men know, in this kingdom by the sea)"
test,"That the wind came out of the cloud by night, chilling and killing my Annabel Lee."
test,But our love it was stronger by far than the love of those older than we --
test,Of many far wiser than we -- 
test,And neither the angels in Heaven above nor the demons down under the sea
test,Can ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
test,"For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams of the beautiful Annabel Lee;"
test,"And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes of the beautiful Annabel Lee;"
test,"And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side of my darling -- my darling -- my life and my bride,"
test,In her sepulchre there by the sea -- in her tomb by the sounding sea.
